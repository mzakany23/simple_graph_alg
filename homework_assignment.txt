Here it is:

Just when you thought you were finished with school work you get another assignment!  =)

Your task is to write a program that solves mazes.  The input to your program is a text file describing the maze.  Your program should read this from standard input.  An example maze is:

###_###
#_____#
#_##_##
#_##__#
#_#####

The # represent walls of the maze, and the underscores represent the open areas.  Rows of the maze are separated by newlines ('\n').  Your program should print a solution to standard output like this:

###a###
#dcb__#
#e##_##
#f##__#
#g#####






Here the lower case letters a represent the path through the maze.  If the maze is large enough that it requires more than 26 steps to go through it, simply start at 'a' again after 'z'.  

Too easy?  If you were able to get that done in a hurry and are bored, try to present only the shortest solution to the maze if there is more than one solution. 
Please submit your solution code via email, packaged in a way that it can run without any nonstandard external libraries.  You may submit them to me, Rob Tandy, rtandy@findaway.com.  CC Kim Sullivan, ksullivan@findaway.com.  

Please get back to us with any questions or clarifications you may need on the assignment!
